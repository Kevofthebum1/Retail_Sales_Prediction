# Retail Sales Forecasting Prediction

This project forecasts weekly retail sales using Python and machine learning techniques.
It was completed as part of **The Build Fellowship (Sept–Oct 2025)** under the mentorship of **Nicholas Yuwono**.

# Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build a predictive model that helps retailers understand sales trends, plan inventory, and make better data-driven business decisions.

# What I Built

* Developed a linear regression model in Python using scikit-learn, achieving ~83% prediction accuracy

* Engineered a 3-week lag feature to capture time-dependent patterns and improve model performance

* Cleaned, merged, and validated three datasets (sales, holidays, and economic indicators)

* Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key drivers of weekly sales

# Tools and Techniques

* Python, Pandas, NumPy

* scikit-learn (Regression Modeling)

* Matplotlib / Seaborn (Visualization)

* Google Colab

# Results

* Achieved **83% accuracy** on weekly sales forecasting

* Improved model performance using lag-based feature engineering

* Identified trends driven by seasonality, holiday proximity, and economic factors
